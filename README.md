ASTEROID DEFENDERS
==================

This is a simple space shooter. This was the first thing I programmed myself outside of the scope of a book or a tutorial, so the code is not exactly the best.

Keep the asteroids from attacking your base, but try not to get destroyed yourself!

Controls:
Arrow Keys - Move
Spacebar - Shoot
