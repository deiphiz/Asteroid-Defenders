EPIC SPACE SHOOTER
==================

This is a simple, *ahem*, EPIC space shooter. This was the first thing I programmed myself outside of the scope of a book or a tutorial, so the code is not exactly the best.

Included are three versions. One is the original, the second is a version with my implemented acceleration movement, and the third is playable with a game controller.

I probably won't be touching this code ever again, so...
